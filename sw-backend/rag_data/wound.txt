1. Abrasions

Overview:
Superficial wound caused by friction scraping off the top layer of skin (epidermis). Common in road accidents, sports injuries, or falls. Usually minor but prone to infection if not cleaned properly.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Falling or sliding against a rough surface (road, concrete, floor)
- Sports injuries or accidents
- Inadequate wound cleaning
- Immunocompromised patients or diabetics (delayed healing)

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Raw, red skin surface with mild bleeding or oozing
- Pain, burning sensation, mild swelling
- Crusting or scab formation during healing
- Signs of infection: pus, warmth, redness spreading around wound

Diagnosis:
- Visual examination to determine wound depth and contamination
- Rarely requires imaging unless foreign bodies are suspected

Treatment and Medications:
- Clean thoroughly with saline or mild antiseptic solution
- Apply topical antibiotic (e.g., mupirocin, neomycin)
- Cover with sterile, non-stick dressing
- Tetanus prophylaxis if wound is contaminated
- Analgesics for pain if required

Home Care and Prevention:
- Keep clean and dry; avoid picking scabs
- Replace dressings daily
- Wear protective gear during sports or travel
- Seek care if redness, swelling, or pus develops

2. Bruises (Contusions)

Overview:
Closed soft-tissue injury caused by blunt trauma leading to bleeding under the skin (hematoma). No external wound, but discoloration occurs due to blood leakage.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Direct blunt trauma (falls, hits, sports injuries)
- Medications like anticoagulants (aspirin, warfarin)
- Fragile blood vessels in elderly or chronic illness
- Coagulation disorders

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Blue, purple, or greenish skin discoloration
- Tenderness, mild swelling, pain
- No open wound
- Large bruises or deep muscle bruises may limit mobility

Diagnosis:
- Clinical observation
- Imaging (X-ray or ultrasound) if bone or deep muscle injury suspected

Treatment and Medications:
- Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation (RICE protocol)
- Analgesics (paracetamol preferred; avoid NSAIDs if bleeding risk)
- Warm compresses after 48 hours to promote healing

Home Care and Prevention:
- Avoid further trauma
- Elevate limb to reduce swelling
- Seek care if bruise enlarges rapidly or is painful without clear cause

3. Burns

- Severe burns: IV fluids, hospitalization, possible grafts
- Tetanus prophylaxis

Home Care and Prevention:
- Keep covered with sterile non-stick dressing
- Hydration and avoid bursting blisters
- Prevent by using protective gear, child safety measures

4. Cut (Minor Laceration)

Overview:
An open wound caused by sharp objects like glass, knives, or metal. May vary from shallow surface cuts to deeper tissue injuries.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Sharp object injuries
- Kitchen, workplace, or industrial accidents
- Poor wound cleaning increases infection risk
- Diabetics and elderly heal slower

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Visible break in skin with bleeding
- Pain, mild swelling
- Deeper cuts may expose fat or muscle tissue

Diagnosis:
- Clinical inspection
- Assess for foreign body or deep tissue involvement

Treatment and Medications:
- Stop bleeding with direct pressure
- Clean thoroughly with saline
- Apply antibiotic ointment
- Close with bandage, adhesive strip, or sutures if needed
- Tetanus prophylaxis if contaminated

Home Care and Prevention:
- Keep wound clean and covered
- Change dressing daily
- Seek care if bleeding persists or wound edges gape open

5. Diabetic Wounds (Foot Ulcers)

Overview:
Chronic wounds in diabetic patients due to neuropathy, ischemia, and infection. Common on feet or pressure areas. High risk of amputation if untreated.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Poor blood sugar control
- Loss of sensation (neuropathy)
- Poor circulation (ischemia)
- Inadequate foot care, ill-fitting shoes

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Open wound, often painless
- Foul odor, discharge, black necrotic tissue
- Delayed healing
- Swelling, redness, or fever (infection)

Diagnosis:
- Clinical examination, wound culture, and imaging (to rule out bone infection)
- Blood glucose and vascular assessment

Treatment and Medications:
- Debridement of dead tissue
- Antibiotics for infection
- Moist wound care dressings
- Pressure offloading (special shoes or casts)
- Blood sugar control

Home Care and Prevention:
- Daily foot inspection
- Avoid walking barefoot
- Regular checkups with podiatrist
- Proper footwear and hygiene

6. Laceration (Deep Cut / Tear)

Overview:
Tear or split in skin or tissue, often caused by blunt trauma or accidents. Deeper than a simple cut and may involve muscle or tendon.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Blunt or sharp force trauma
- Industrial or household accidents
- Falls, motor vehicle collisions
- Poor first aid or infection risk

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Deep wound edges, irregular shape
- Bleeding, pain, swelling
- Visible tissue damage
- Possible numbness (nerve injury)

Diagnosis:

Treatment and Medications:
- Clean wound thoroughly
- Surgical closure (sutures or staples) if deep
- Antibiotics for contaminated wounds
