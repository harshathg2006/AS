- Immunosuppression

Symptoms and Clinical Presentation:
- Redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness
- Rapid spread, usually in one leg
- Fever, chills, fatigue
- Possible blistering, abscess, or peau d’orange (orange peel texture)

Diagnosis:
- Clinical examination
- Cultures or imaging if abscess suspected

Treatment and Medications:
- Oral antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin)
- MRSA-specific antibiotics if needed
- Rest, limb elevation, hydration
- IV antibiotics for severe cases

Home Care and Prevention:
- Clean wounds properly
- Treat fungal foot infections
